# graphql-functions

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/graphql-functions.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/graphql-functions)
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/comparaonline/graphql-ruby-functions.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/comparaonline/graphql-ruby-functions)

Ruby gem made to simplify the standard query creation of the [graphql](http://graphql-ruby.org) gem in your `Active Record` models with predefined **functions**.

Using the provided functions your graphql **types** will gain standard and generic **query arguments** to limit the amount of rows, use an offset, or filter by an specific id among others; supporting queries like the following:

```graphql
{
  people(limit: 2) {
    id,
    first_name
  }  
}
```

```graphql
{
  people(ids: [1, 4, 9]) {
    id,
    age
  }
}
```

```graphql
{
  person(id: 3) {
    id,
    last_name
  }
}
```

The full list of features is shown [here](#features).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql-functions'
```

And then execute:
```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```
$ gem install graphql-functions
```

Please note that you should also have installed the base [graphql](http://graphql-ruby.org) gem.

## Usage

First of all you have to honor the following files structure convention:

```
app\
--controllers\
--models\
----person.rb
--graphql\
----types\
------query_type.rb
------person_type.rb
----mutations\
----functions\
------person.rb
------people.rb
----schema.rb
```

To help getting started is useful to use the `graphql` [generator](http://graphql-ruby.org/schema/generators#graphqlinstall).

Then you should use one of the two provided functions to the `query type` definition:

```ruby
# app/graphql/types/query_type.rb
module Types
  QueryType = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    name "Query"

    field :person, function: GraphQL::Functions::Element
    field :people, function: GraphQL::Functions::Array
  end
end
```

If more specific logic is needed you may create a custom class with an inheritance from `GraphQL::Functions::Element` or `GraphQL::Functions::Array` like:

```ruby
# app/graphql/functions/people.rb
module Functions
  class People < GraphQL::Functions::Array
    model ::Person
    argument :country_code, types.String

    def call(obj, args, ctx)
      query = super(obj, args, ctx)
      query.where(country_code: args[:countryCode]) if args[:countryCode]
      query
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/graphql/types/query_type.rb
module Types
  QueryType = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    name "Query"

    field :person, function: GraphQL::Functions::Element
    field :people, function: Functions::People
  end
end
```

Above changes will in addition to the base query capabilities from `graphql-functions` allow the query to filter by countryCode like:

```
{
  query(countryCode: 'us', limit: 2, offset: 5) {
    id,
    first_name,
    last_name
  }
}
```

## Features

### Element
Element function is intended to be used with a query with a single field output like `person` in the example: The only available argument is id:
- `id: Int`. Filter by the specified id.

### Array
Array function add filters-like arguments to the query:
- `offset: Int`). Skip the specified argument of records.
- `limit: Int`). Do not return more rows than the argument.
- `Ã¬ds: [Int]`). Filter by the specified ids.


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
